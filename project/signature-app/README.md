Signature App
================
Give a tool to your clients so they can build out every email signature they need.

Will be able to either copy the front in view or click the button at the bottom to have the HTML version copied to their clipboard.

1) Build the signature your client wants in code.html.

2) Minify the html. 

Be sure to find and replace all single quotes and replace them with double quotes.

3) Copy the snippets of code in the index.html in the correct javascript varables. 

Done.

The heavy lifting is in the design of code.html.

As of right now you'll have to feel your way around your minifed code into the right variables. Remeber, there can be no single quotes in your HTML.
